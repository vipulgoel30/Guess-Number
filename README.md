This game was made throughout the course utilising the ***CSS, HTML, and Vanilla Js*** tech stack.<br>
This game, named  ***Guess the number***, is quite straightforward and simply requires you to guess a number between 1 and 20 (both included).<br>
The game will then indicate if your guess is higher or lower than the original number.<br>
You have ***five chances*** to properly guess the number.
