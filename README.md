This game was made throughout the course utilising the CSS, HTML, and Vanilla Js tech stack.
This game, named ## Guess the number, is quite straightforward and simply requires you to guess a number between 1 and 20 (both included). The game will then indicate if your guess is higher or lower than the original number.
You have five chances to properly guess the number.
